        Hello everybody!
        I just published an iOS app named csBuddies (link at the bottom), and it's perfect for you to make friends who are programmers.

        Using a comprehensive filtering system, you can easily discover like-minded coders who share similar interests as you.
        And after finding programmers you'd like to chat, you can simply text them to start a conversation.
        If you wish to make programmer friends, discuss fun coding projects, or simply talk about computer science in general, then csBuddies is the community for you!

        I designed this chat app using SwiftUI, and I'm definitely planning to update it continuously as I take into account all of your feedback.
        Thank you so much for reading, and please feel free to comment here or email me at csbuddiesapp@gmail.com for any kind of feedback!

        Hi r/HackingWithSwift
        Sorry if this question is stupid. I am new to programming in general, not just Swift.
        I would like to put this (mockup) in my project with SwiftUI. It is like how Zelda BotW shows HP. 1 value with a small symbol, 1 unit of values (4 or 5) is shown with a big symbol.
        The number would get to 3 digits so I can't really do it one by one. I tried text view and array but they can't parse SF symbols/images. HStack won't return a new line. It hasn't even got to the big and small icon thing and I am already out of my depth.
        Any advice or pointers appreciated.
